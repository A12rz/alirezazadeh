This paper presents an enhanced deep learning framework that addresses class imbalance in hate speech detection through multiple complementary strategies.  Our approach extends DistilBERT with an additional multi-head attention mechanism for task-specific semantic understanding and introduces class-specific processing branches enabling specialized feature learning for each content category. 

We implement an advanced focal loss function with dynamic class weighting and label smoothing, combined with intelligent hybrid sampling strategies and minority class boosting mechanisms. The framework incorporates 20 linguistic features capturing domain specific patterns to handle severe class imbalance where minority classes are substantially underrepresented. 

Experimental validation on the Davidson hate speech dataset demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 91.57% and weighted-averaged F1-scores of 93.73%. Our approach excels in minority class detection while maintaining robust performance across all categories, with individual class F1-scores ranging from 88.36% to 95.55%, providing a comprehensive solution for balanced and effective content moderation capabilities.
